# RedEye   ![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/40l1bf7fj0ceeq1u?svg=true)
At first this was a Project for learning ML.NET but I ended up not using it at all because Emgu.CV worked way better and easier.

If you want to try your own images, then place them in the "examples" folder or a subfolder in your installation folder.

If you want to change any settings, then edit the "config.csv" in your Documents folder under "RedEye".
