# RedEye   ![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/40l1bf7fj0ceeq1u?svg=true)
At first this was a Project for learning ML.NET but I ended up not using it at all because Emgu.CV worked way better and easier.

If you want to try your own images, then place them in `bin\assets\examples` in your installation folder.

If you want to change any settings, then edit the `RedEye\config.csv` in your Documents folder. **BUT** `Cuda` doesn't work until this [Issue](https://github.com/emgucv/emgucv/issues/328) gets resolved.
